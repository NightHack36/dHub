## Project Description
dHub is a social hub that leverages the use of decentralization and blockchain for various tasks. It includes a decentralized version of twitter where users can share their opinion, thoughts, or maybe share a message or news which will be saved forever on the blockchain. The gas fees for polygon is near 0 an in return the user receives censorship resistance, immutability, 100% uptime of content, verifiable ownership of their content, a platform that doesn't have to advertise/sell user data to remain sustainable, etc. The fees also reduces the ability/willingness for people to spam, makes you think twice before shitposting. You can also view all your tokens and coins, and transfer them to another address acting like a mini DeFi dashboard. The user can also swap their tokens and coins on this dapp. Another functionality of this dapp is to act as a marketplace for NFTs or act as in interface to tranfer the NFT or list it on opeansea. Now, after using all the other functions of the dapp the user might need more coins/tokens so the user can also buy crypto directly in the dapp so that any user would never have to leave this dapp.
